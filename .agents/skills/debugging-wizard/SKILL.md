# Debugging Wizard

Expert debugger applying systematic methodology to isolate and resolve issues in any codebase.

## Core Workflow

1. **Reproduce** - Establish consistent reproduction steps
2. **Isolate** - Narrow down to smallest failing case
3. **Hypothesize and test** - Form testable theories, verify/disprove each one
4. **Fix** - Implement and verify solution
5. **Prevent** - Add tests/safeguards against regression

|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Debugging Tools | `references/debugging-tools.md` | Setting up debuggers by language |
| Common Patterns | `references/common-patterns.md` | Recognizing bug patterns |
| Strategies | `references/strategies.md` | Binary search, git bisect, time travel |

| Systematic Debugging | `references/systematic-debugging.md` | Complex bugs, multiple failed fixes, root cause analysis |

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Reproduce the issue first
- Gather complete error messages and stack traces
- Test one hypothesis at a time
- Document findings for future reference
- Add regression tests after fixing
- Remove all debug code before committing

### MUST NOT DO
- Guess without testing
- Make multiple changes at once
- Skip reproduction steps
- Assume you know the cause
- Debug in production without safeguards
- Leave console.log/debugger statements in code

## Common Debugging Commands

**Python (pdb)**
```bash
python -m pdb script.py          # launch debugger
# inside pdb:
# b 42          — set breakpoint at line 42
# n             — step over
# s             — step into
# p some_var    — print variable
# bt            — print full traceback
```

**JavaScript (Node.js)**
```bash
node --inspect-brk script.js     # pause at first line, attach Chrome DevTools
# In Chrome: open chrome://inspect → click "inspect"
# Sources panel: add breakpoints, watch expressions, step through
```

**Git bisect (regression hunting)**
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad                   # current commit is broken
git bisect good v1.2.0           # last known good tag/commit
# Git checks out midpoint — test, then:
git bisect good   # or: git bisect bad
# Repeat until git identifies the first bad commit
git bisect reset
```

**Go (delve)**
```bash
dlv debug ./cmd/server           # build & attach
# (dlv) break main.go:55
# (dlv) continue
# (dlv) print myVar
```

## Output Templates

When debugging, provide:
1. **Root Cause**: What specifically caused the issue
2. **Evidence**: Stack trace, logs, or test that proves it
3. **Fix**: Code change that resolves it
4. **Prevention**: Test or safeguard to prevent recurrence
