# Scientific Python Testing with pytest

A comprehensive guide to writing effective tests for scientific Python packages using pytest, following the [Scientific Python Community guidelines](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/guides/pytest/) and [testing tutorial](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/tutorials/test/). This skill focuses on modern testing patterns, fixtures, parametrization, and best practices specific to scientific computing.

## Quick Reference Card

**Common Testing Tasks - Quick Decisions:**

```python
# 1. Basic test → Use simple assert
def test_function():
    assert result == expected

# 2. Floating-point comparison → Use approx
from pytest import approx
assert result == approx(0.333, rel=1e-6)

# 3. Testing exceptions → Use pytest.raises
with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="must be positive"):
    function(-1)

# 4. Multiple inputs → Use parametrize
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [(1,1), (2,4), (3,9)])
def test_square(input, expected):
    assert input**2 == expected

# 5. Reusable setup → Use fixture
@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# 6. NumPy arrays → Use approx or numpy.testing
assert np.mean(data) == approx(3.0)
```

**Decision Tree:**
- Need multiple test cases with same logic? → **Parametrize**
- Need reusable test data/setup? → **Fixture**
- Testing floating-point results? → **pytest.approx**
- Testing exceptions/warnings? → **pytest.raises / pytest.warns**
- Complex numerical arrays? → **numpy.testing.assert_allclose**
- Organizing by speed? → **Markers and separate directories**

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing tests for scientific Python packages and libraries
- Testing numerical algorithms and scientific computations
- Setting up test infrastructure for research software
- Implementing continuous integration for scientific code
- Testing data analysis pipelines and workflows
- Validating scientific simulations and models
- Ensuring reproducibility and correctness of research code
- Testing code that uses NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and other scientific libraries

## Core Concepts

### 1. Why pytest for Scientific Python

pytest is the de facto standard for testing Python packages because it:

- **Simple syntax**: Just use Python's `assert` statement
- **Detailed reporting**: Clear, informative failure messages
- **Powerful features**: Fixtures, parametrization, marks, plugins
- **Scientific ecosystem**: Native support for NumPy arrays, approximate comparisons
- **Community standard**: Used by NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and more

### 2. Test Structure and Organization

**Standard test directory layout:**

```text
my-package/
├── src/
│   └── my_package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── analysis.py
│       └── utils.py
├── tests/
│   ├── conftest.py
│   ├── test_analysis.py
│   └── test_utils.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

**Key principles:**

- Tests directory separate from source code (alongside `src/`)
- Test files named `test_*.py` (pytest discovery)
- Test functions named `test_*` (pytest discovery)
- No `__init__.py` in tests directory (avoid importability issues)
- Test against installed package, not local source

### 3. pytest Configuration

See [assets/pyproject-pytest.toml](assets/pyproject-pytest.toml) for a complete pytest configuration example.

Basic configuration in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
minversion = "7.0"
addopts = [
    "-ra",              # Show summary of all test outcomes
    "--showlocals",     # Show local variables in tracebacks
    "--strict-markers", # Error on undefined markers
    "--strict-config",  # Error on config issues
]
testpaths = ["tests"]
```

## Testing Principles

Following the [Scientific Python testing recommendations](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/principles/testing/), effective testing provides multiple benefits and should follow key principles:

### Advantages of Testing

- **Trustworthy code**: Well-tested code behaves as expected and can be relied upon
- **Living documentation**: Tests communicate intent and expected behavior, validated with each run
- **Preventing failure**: Tests protect against implementation errors and unexpected dependency changes
- **Confidence when making changes**: Thorough test suites enable adding features, fixing bugs, and refactoring with confidence

### Fundamental Principles

**1. Any test case is better than none**

When in doubt, write the test that makes sense at the time:
- Test critical behaviors, features, and logic
- Write clear, expressive, well-documented tests
- Tests are documentation of developer intentions
- Good tests make it clear what they are testing and how

Don't get bogged down in taxonomy when learning—focus on writing tests that work.

**2. As long as that test is correct**

It's surprisingly easy to write tests that pass when they should fail:
- **Check that your test fails when it should**: Deliberately break the code and verify the test fails
- **Keep it simple**: Excessive mocks and fixtures make it difficult to know what's being tested
- **Test one thing at a time**: A single test should test a single behavior

**3. Start with Public Interface Tests**

Begin by testing from the perspective of a user:
- Test code as users will interact with it
- Keep tests simple and readable for documentation purposes
- Focus on supported use cases
- Avoid testing private attributes
- Minimize use of mocks/patches

**4. Organize Tests into Suites**

Divide tests by type and execution time for efficiency:
- **Unit tests**: Fast, isolated tests of individual components
- **Integration tests**: Tests of component interactions and dependencies
- **End-to-end tests**: Complete workflow testing

Benefits:
- Run relevant tests quickly and frequently
- "Fail fast" by running fast suites first
- Easier to read and reason about
- Avoid false positives from expected external failures

### Outside-In Testing Approach

The recommended approach is **outside-in**, starting from the user's perspective:

1. **Public Interface Tests**: Test from user perspective, focusing on behavior and features
2. **Integration Tests**: Test that components work together and with dependencies
3. **Unit Tests**: Test individual units in isolation, optimized for speed

This approach ensures you're building the right thing before optimizing implementation details.

## Quick Start

### Minimal Test Example

```python
# tests/test_basic.py

def test_simple_math():
    """Test basic arithmetic."""
    assert 4 == 2**2

def test_string_operations():
    """Test string methods."""
    result = "hello world".upper()
    assert result == "HELLO WORLD"
    assert "HELLO" in result
```

### Scientific Test Example

```python
# tests/test_scientific.py
import numpy as np
from pytest import approx

from my_package.analysis import compute_mean, fit_linear

def test_compute_mean():
    """Test mean calculation."""
    data = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    result = compute_mean(data)
    assert result == approx(3.0)

def test_fit_linear():
    """Test linear regression."""
    x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    y = np.array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])
    slope, intercept = fit_linear(x, y)

    assert slope == approx(2.0)
    assert intercept == approx(0.0)
```

## Testing Patterns

See [references/test-patterns.md](references/test-patterns.md) for detailed patterns including:
- Writing simple, focused tests
- Testing for failures
- Approximate comparisons
- Using fixtures
- Parametrized tests
- Test organization with markers
- Mocking and monkeypatching
- Testing against installed version
- Import best practices

## Scientific Python Testing Patterns

See [references/scientific-patterns.md](references/scientific-patterns.md) for scientific-specific patterns:
- Testing numerical algorithms
- Testing with different NumPy dtypes
- Testing random/stochastic code
- Testing data pipelines
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis

## Running pytest

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific file
pytest tests/test_analysis.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_analysis.py::test_mean

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "mean or median"

# Verbose output
pytest -v

# Show local variables in failures
pytest -l  # or --showlocals

# Stop at first failure
pytest -x

# Show stdout/stderr
pytest -s
```

### Debugging Tests

```bash
# Drop into debugger on failure
pytest --pdb

# Drop into debugger at start of each test
pytest --trace

# Run last failed tests
pytest --lf

# Run failed tests first, then rest
pytest --ff

# Show which tests would be run (dry run)
pytest --collect-only
```

### Coverage

```bash
# Install pytest-cov
pip install pytest-cov

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=my_package

# With coverage report
pytest --cov=my_package --cov-report=html

# With missing lines
pytest --cov=my_package --cov-report=term-missing

# Fail if coverage below threshold
pytest --cov=my_package --cov-fail-under=90
```

See [assets/pyproject-pytest.toml](assets/pyproject-pytest.toml) for complete coverage configuration.

## Summary

Testing scientific Python code with pytest, following Scientific Python community principles, provides:

1. **Confidence**: Know your code works correctly
2. **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent behavior across environments
3. **Documentation**: Tests show how code should be used and communicate developer intent
4. **Refactoring safety**: Change code without breaking functionality
5. **Regression prevention**: Catch bugs before they reach users
6. **Scientific rigor**: Validate numerical accuracy and physical correctness

**Key testing principles:**

- Start with **public interface tests** from the user's perspective
- Organize tests into **suites** (unit, integration, e2e) by type and speed
- Follow **outside-in** approach: public interface → integration → unit tests
- Keep tests **simple, focused, and independent**
- Test **behavior rather than implementation**
- Use pytest's powerful features (fixtures, parametrization, markers) effectively
- Always verify tests **fail when they should** to avoid false confidence

**Remember**: Any test is better than none, but well-organized tests following these principles create trustworthy, maintainable scientific software that the community can rely on.
