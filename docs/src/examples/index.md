# Examples Index

This section provides focused code examples for specific tasks using Symusic. Unlike the [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md), these examples are shorter and aim to demonstrate a particular function or technique quickly.

## Available Example Categories

-   **[Music Analysis](./analysis.md)**: Snippets for extracting features and statistics from musical data.
-   **[Music Generation](./generation.md)**: Examples related to creating or manipulating musical structures programmatically (Note: Symusic focuses on processing existing data, but can be used to structure generated data).
-   **[Data Preprocessing](./preprocessing.md)**: Quick examples for cleaning, filtering, and preparing MIDI data for other applications.

*(More examples will be added over time. Contributions are welcome!)*
