# Documentation TODOs

This checklist tracks pending work for the Sphinx migration.

- [ ] Port Tutorials section from mdBook (MIDI operations, piano roll, synthesis, data processing).
- [ ] Port Examples (analysis, generation, preprocessing) with updated code snippets.
- [ ] Integrate `tutorial.ipynb` via myst-nb and ensure deterministic outputs.
- [ ] Add FAQ / troubleshooting entry for installation, compiler requirements, and common runtime errors.
- [ ] Draft migration guide highlighting differences between 0.x mdBook and 1.0 documentation.
- [ ] Wire up Doxygen + Breathe for C++ internals (Score/Track/Event/IO/Synth).
- [ ] Document contribution workflow (docstring conventions, nb::doc usage, doc build in CI).
- [ ] Replace legacy GitHub Pages workflow with Read the Docs badge + link once RTD site is live.
