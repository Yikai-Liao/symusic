# Symusic Documentation (WIP)

This site hosts the in-progress Sphinx documentation for the upcoming **symusic 1.0** release.
It consolidates Python and C++ references, tutorials, and migration notes that will eventually
replace the legacy mdBook.

> **Heads up:** the old mdBook under `docs/src` is still served on GitHub Pages, but much of that
> content is stale. The sections below highlight the refreshed structure and call out legacy
> references explicitly.
