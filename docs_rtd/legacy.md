# Legacy Material

The original symusic documentation lives in an mdBook under `docs/src`. It still covers important
concepts, but several APIs mentioned there have been renamed or removed.

- Live site: <https://yikai-liao.github.io/symusic/>
- Sources: `docs/src/*.md`

We will progressively port the useful parts into this Sphinx site. In the meantime:

- Treat mdBook snippets as historical context rather than the source of truth.
- Prefer the Tutorials/Examples pages here once they appear—they will be tested against CI.
- If you discover inaccuracies in mdBook pages, open an issue referencing the page so we can fold the
  fix directly into the MyST version instead of patching the legacy copy.
